# Air Writing Recognition Project

This project aims to develop an air writing recognition system that can recognize alphabets, numbers, or other specified gestures drawn in the air using a webcam.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **data_processing.py**: Contains functions for preprocessing video data and generating datasets.
- **model.py**: Defines the architecture of the deep learning model used for gesture recognition.
- **train.py**: Script for training the gesture recognition model.
- **evaluate.py**: Script for evaluating the trained model on test data.
- **real_time_recognition.py**: Implementation of real-time gesture recognition using a trained model.
- **src/**: Directory containing modularized versions of the code files for better organization.
- **data/**: Directory for storing raw videos, processed images, and datasets.
- **models/**: Directory for saving trained model checkpoints.
- **reports/**: Directory for project documentation and presentations.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages for easy environment setup.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
